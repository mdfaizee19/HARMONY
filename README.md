# HARMONY

**HARMONY is a personal financial enforcement layer that sits between user intent and execution.**  
It prevents bad financial decisions by simulating future commitments and enforcing user-defined constraints before any action proceeds.

This is **not** a payment app, chatbot, or budgeting tool.  
HARMONY stages, evaluates, negotiates, and logs decisions before execution.

## What Problem Does HARMONY Solve?

Payments are easy.  
Financial mistakes happen because decisions are made under impulse, stress, or incomplete context.
